GW Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 21 Challenge

## Overview
The analysis is intended for a nonprofit foundation called Alphabet Soup. The analysis is to help the nonprofit select which applicants for funding are most likely to have success with their ventures. As part of the analysis, I created a binary classifier that can predict whether Alphabet Soupâ€™s applicants will be successful. This was done by using a CSV file with data regarding 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. The data includes columns with metadata about each organization including their affiliated sector of industry, government organization classification, the use of the funding, the type of organization, status of activity, income classification, and whether or not the money was used effectively (successfully). These columns were used to predict whether the campaign would be successful.

## Result
When optimizing the model, not dropping the identification columns EIN and NAME as well as increasing the cutoff for the classifications improved the accuracy of the model. 

## File Structure
Files in the repository include a Microsoft Word Document with details about the analysis and results. 
AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb -- initial analysis
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization_1 -- first attempt at optimization
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization_2 -- second attempt at optimization
Each is accompanied by a H5 file with the results.
